<p>Hi there! I’m Andrea Enriquez, a web designer student with a passion aimed to creating clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. Currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design techniques. </p>
    <p>I am working on building my portfolio that includes projects I’ve designed with HTML basics and the designing of Databases.</p>
    <p>My goal is to design online platforms that are not only visually appealing but also easy to navigate. I believe that technology should be shared and accessible to everybody no matter their limitations.  I am excited to continue developing my skills and look forward to contributing to web solutions. 
    Check out the projects shown here and feel free to reach out!</p>
