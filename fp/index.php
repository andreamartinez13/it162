  <!-- Paragraph Info -->
  <p>"The inspiration for Ké Botana came from my father's wine and liquor stores. Customers often asked if he sold
    snacks to accompany their drinks, so they wouldn't have to visit another store.</p>

  <p>To keep the profits within the family, my mother began buying and bagging snacks herself. Starting with just three
    products and initially naming the business "Botanas Myriam" she successfully sustained it for six years. As time
    went by, the manual labor became tiring for her. In 2010, I took over the business, transforming it into a family
    enterprise.</p>

  <p>Under my management, I felt the need to give the brand a fresh start, leading to the creation of Ke Botana. With
    this new beginning, we expanded our product range and offered various sizes to cater to all customer preferences.
  </p>

  <p>Currently, I am passing down the knowledge and materials to my eldest daughter, so that she can choose to continue
    this legacy if she wishes."</p>
